WCK - The point of the exercise was to think the problem out before coding it. To take time to understand the requirements 
by doing a design, to define test cases and test data, etc. You did not do this. You jumped into code so fast you didn't
even code a solution for the right problem. You seemed to redefined the problem and then coded it without any design.
You have no comments. you have no test data or test cases. your logic is flawed. You didn't ask for input or
add the two user numbers together (since you didn't input them), no validation,
AND you didn't use recursion; you looped instead.

-Please go back and read the required materials for the Implementation lesson.

using system;

    static int SumOfDigits(int a) {
        int sum = 0;

        while (a > 0 || sum > 9) {
            if (a == 0) {
                a = sum;
                sum = 0;
            }
            sum += a % 10;
            a /= 10;
        }
        return sum;

        int a = 1111;
        Console.Write(SumOfDigits(n));
    }

WCK- Overall, good job. The point of the exercise was to think the problem out before coding it. To take time to understand the requirements 
by doing a design, to define test cases and test data, etc. You did most of that. Most importantly, you didn't jumpt into coding.


Requirements               WCK- would have been better to just copy what I gave you here and then broken it down into individual requirements
                                because they should read, "Must add the TWO given numbers together". As you wrote it, it doesn't say how many 
                                numbers the user provides. And you missed "Must use recursion"
- Must except user input.    
- Must add the given numbers together.
- Must seperate the least significant digit from the total.   
- Must add the seperated digit to the remaining digits.
- Must add least significant digit continuesly until condition is met.
- Must determine when the added numbers total a single digit.

Constraints                                WCK- good comments here. this gives me context for testing and evaluation
- Will not accept decinamls
- Will not accept negatives
- Will not accept non-integer characters, (# , $ !)

Definition of done
- Transforms 2 user input numbers into a single digit value by adding significant digits.



Psudocode

-
Collect 2 integer inputs from user

Validate inputs

Set Total to the sum of the 2 integers

recursion 
    if Total is less than 10
        return total
    
    else

    seperate least significant digit
    set Answer to remaining digits plus least significant digit

Battleship Test case

1) Test that a missile is launched using either the space key or right-click on the mouse.
	<do this by launching a missile both ways>

2) Test that there are never more than 5 missiles on the screen at once
	<Keep launching missiles until it stops you and ensures there are only 5>

3) Test that a missile is deactivated when it is no longer on screen.
	<launch a missile near the edge of the screen and see if it comes back on screen once it is off>

4) Test that all missiles travel at the same speed
	<launch a few missiles and count how long each one is on the screen>

5) Test that the missiles all launch from the bottom center and that all travel upwards>
	<try to manipulate the launcher to a different location and ensure it only works from the bottom.>
	<change screen size and see if it still launches from the bottom center>
	<mirror screen and see if it stays bottom center.>

6) Test that when a missile hits a ship is detected.
	<change location of hit ships to make sure it detects a hit on all screen locations.>
	<see if a near miss counts as a hit>

7) Test that an explosion occurs when the ship is hit
	<make sure the explosion only occurs at a ship site.>
	<see if there is an explosion when missiles collide>

8) Test to make sure the missile is removed after ship contact
	<Collide missile with the ship and see ship and missile be removed>

9) Test that every hit is counted
	<Launch missiles to make hits and count each contact with ships and make sure counter matches up.>

10) Test that a ship is launched when there a no active ships
	<remove all ships and watch the system add a single ship.>

11) Test that there can be many different types of ships.
	<launch different types of ships and fire missiles to show they can all be hit.>
	<shrink screen size and test that all ships still work.>

12) Test that the right ship image appears for each ship
	<place each ship and check to see if there are different images.>
	<then test each ship on its own to see if the right image appears.>

13) Test that a ship will be launched at default 30% of the time
	<watch time and see that ships are launched at the 30% mark of time.>

14) Test that the system randomly chooses from all ship types at an equal chance of time.
	<write down each ship that is randomly sent and calculate the probability to see if it matches equally.>

15) Test that there are never more than 10 ships on the screen
	<try to launch a ship to see if more than 10 can show up.>

16) Test that the system randomly chooses ship location and direction
	<launch 10 ships and see if they are all placed in a different location.>
	<launch 10 ships and see if they can be launched from right to left or left to right.>

17) Test that the ship is launched from the top two-thirds of the screen on the right.
	<Change screen size and see if the ships are alunched from the same direction.>

18) Test the speed of the ship when launched based on type
	<see if each ship comes in at a different speed>
	<send a small ship and watch it move fast>
	<Send a large ship and watch it move slow>

19) Test the direction of the ship based on which side it is launched.
	<if it is launched from the left, it should face the right.>
	<if it is launched from the right, it should face the left.>
 
20) Test that the ships are removed once off screen.
	<see if the ship comes back on screen after it passes by>
	<change screen size and see if it affects the ships active time.>

21) Test the ending of the game.
	<hit 10 ships and see if game ends>
	<click left button on mouse and see if game ends>
	<click esc button and see if game ends>
	<Wait for 5 minutes with no activity and see if the game ends>

WCK- overall, these are good. feedback inline below with WCK- prefix.


Battleship Test case

1) Test that a missile is launched using either the space key or right-click on the mouse.
	<do this by launching a missile both ways>

2) Test that there are never more than 5 missiles on the screen at once
	<Keep launching missiles until it stops you and ensures there are only 5>

3) Test that a missile is deactivated when it is no longer on screen.
	<launch a missile near the edge of the screen and see if it comes back on screen once it is off>
	WCK- all missiles are launched from the same location so you can't launch near edge of the screen.
	you can test this requirment by launching 5 missiles, keeping hitting spacebar repeatedly, once the first 
	missile goes off the screen a new missile will be launched but not before.

4) Test that all missiles travel at the same speed
	<launch a few missiles and count how long each one is on the screen>

5) Test that the missiles all launch from the bottom center and that all travel upwards>
	<try to manipulate the launcher to a different location and ensure it only works from the bottom.>
	<change screen size and see if it still launches from the bottom center>
	<mirror screen and see if it stays bottom center.>
WCK- these are very good. 

6) Test that when a missile hits a ship is detected.
	<change location of hit ships to make sure it detects a hit on all screen locations.>
	<see if a near miss counts as a hit>
WCK- I reviewed yours last (just the way it happened) and you are the only one I remember that 
took a near miss into consideratin. Excellent.


7) Test that an explosion occurs when the ship is hit
	<make sure the explosion only occurs at a ship site.>
	<see if there is an explosion when missiles collide>

8) Test to make sure the missile is removed after ship contact
	<Collide missile with the ship and see ship and missile be removed>

9) Test that every hit is counted
	<Launch missiles to make hits and count each contact with ships and make sure counter matches up.>

10) Test that a ship is launched when there a no active ships
	<remove all ships and watch the system add a single ship.>
	WCK- can't remove all ships without changing code. But you could change the config rate to 
	be 0%, which should cause no ships to be launched except this requirement should force one
	to be launched. thus you will have one and only one and always one ship on the screen.

11) Test that there can be many different types of ships.
	<launch different types of ships and fire missiles to show they can all be hit.>
	<shrink screen size and test that all ships still work.>

12) Test that the right ship image appears for each ship
	<place each ship and check to see if there are different images.>
	<then test each ship on its own to see if the right image appears.> WCK- PERFECT

13) Test that a ship will be launched at default 30% of the time
	<watch time and see that ships are launched at the 30% mark of time.>
	WCK- the test for this is covered with some other by changing the rate to 0%, 100%, and then
	leave it blank (the default);

14) Test that the system randomly chooses from all ship types at an equal chance of time.
	<write down each ship that is randomly sent and calculate the probability to see if it matches equally.>

15) Test that there are never more than 10 ships on the screen
	<try to launch a ship to see if more than 10 can show up.>
	WCK- this is where you set the config rate to 100%, a cluster of ships should appear on the
	left and right; and no more than 10 total until they start to go off the screen and then 
	more will appear.

16) Test that the system randomly chooses ship location and direction
	<launch 10 ships and see if they are all placed in a different location.>
	<launch 10 ships and see if they can be launched from right to left or left to right.>

17) Test that the ship is launched from the top two-thirds of the screen on the right.
	<Change screen size and see if the ships are alunched from the same direction.>

18) Test the speed of the ship when launched based on type
	<see if each ship comes in at a different speed>
	<send a small ship and watch it move fast>
	<Send a large ship and watch it move slow>

19) Test the direction of the ship based on which side it is launched.
	<if it is launched from the left, it should face the right.>
	<if it is launched from the right, it should face the left.>
 
20) Test that the ships are removed once off screen.
	<see if the ship comes back on screen after it passes by>
	<change screen size and see if it affects the ships active time.>

21) Test the ending of the game.
	<hit 10 ships and see if game ends>
	<click left button on mouse and see if game ends>
	<click esc button and see if game ends>
	<Wait for 5 minutes with no activity and see if the game ends>

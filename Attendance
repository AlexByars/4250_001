E00575735:Present 9/27/22 For the semester project, building a complete iteration would be a nice bonus, but the best outcome is for us to collaborate and communicate effectively to simulate a real agile/development team, demonstrating our learning and comprehension of concepts discussed in class.

E00613440: I believe that what you want to get out of this project is not necisarily a perfect working product as you said yourself that it would take many semesters of students to complete. Rather show the processes that we have been going over in class to create a good product.

to give us a hands-on experience in the design and implementation of a software system.
us learn to communicate how we have made progress each week.
Everyone to do their best and show that we have made as much progress as we can
Develop our SWECOM skills

E00619428: 9/27/22 - That we understand the concepts taught to us in class, and know how to apply them.

E00668656: 9/27/2022 10/20/2022 Your goal for this project is going to be having us put into practice the skills we have been speaking about in class as well as further expanding our abilities to work with a team and we will see the difficulties that come with it as there are skills which many of us do not have experience with so we may need to work hard to make it work.

E00569128 10/18/2022 - getting a hands on experience using design and implementation. also, to utilize proper practice as a software engineer


I believe Kinser is interested in how well we apply the concepts/learning objectives in each sprint. He will also be interested in seeing working software,
as this is software engineering, but I think he will be most interested in the previous statement. In each class exercise, Kinser has looked not at the completion,
but at the process and how well we understood the topic.

Strong in C#, SQL, source control (Github, Azure devops)
Pretty good at using a database, not so much setting one up
Mainly focused on backend development, not much experience in the front end

I'm good at organizing and breaking down a project. 
Constantly focused on the end result instead of getting caught up in the details.

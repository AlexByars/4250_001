WCK - overall, a good job. Your comments explain what was happening. I found a few minor issues and some missing test cases (but you did have some)
      more comments below prefixed with WCK-

// Take two numbers in from the user (a human) and add them together then separate the least significant digit
// and add it the remaining digits and so on until you have a single digit answer

// ASSUMPTIONS:
// - The user input must be integers, i.e. constrained from 2^31 - 1 to -2^31
// - Overflows and underflows from adding inputs are permissible
// - Negative input values are permissable


bool notNumber = true
int num1                  WCK- it is always good practice to initialize variables; even if the system does it for you or you are sure you don't use it till set
int num2

// Read in the first number and make sure that it's a valid integer
print "Please enter a first number, as a digit"                            WCK- this prompt implies a single digit "as a digit", not what you wanted right?
while (notNumber)		// Loop will continue until input is a valid int
	string input = read()
	
	if (input.TryParse() not a valid int)
		print "That is not a digit."      WCK- "a digit" or "an integer value"
	else
		num1 = input
		notNumber = false

// Read in the second number and make sure that it's a valid integer
print "Please enter a second number, as a digit"
notNumber = true
while (notNumber)		// Loop will continue until input is a valid int
	sring input = read()

	if (input.TryParse() not a valid int)
		print "That is not a digit. 
	else
		num2 = input
		notNumber = false


try 
	funct(num1, num2)
catch (RecursiveDepthException)
	print "The two inputs cannot be processed."

        WCK - good comments for funct but poor naming; name should be descriptive (e.g. recursiveFunction); No need to abbreviate names, doesn't save space

// This function takes in two integers, adds them together, and if the result isn't a single digit
// then separates the result into least significant digit and remaining digit and recursively calls
// the function using those two integers as input. The function also takes a depth parameter that 
// measures the recursive depth, and terminates the function before it can overflow the stack by
// throwing an exception. Negative integers are allowed as inputs, and as a result it is also
// possible to get a negative output. The depth variable which records the recursive depth has a
// default value of 0 if nothing is passed, and gets incremented upon each recursive call; the
// function throws an exception if the maximum depth of 10 is surpassed.
int funct(int num1, int num2, int depth = 0)
	if (depth > 10 || depth < 0)
		throw RecursiveDepthException

	int result = num1 + num2                   WCK- what if num1 and num2 are maxInt; you said earlier overflow is okay but you won't exit gracefully
	                                                
	
	                                           WCK- clever. I didn't think of this as the exit condition
	if ((result / 10) == 0)		// If the result / 10 is equal to 0, then result is a single digit, so we're done
		return result
	else				// Otherwise we need to call the function again
		int LSD = result % 10	// Modulo by 10 leaves the least significant digit
		int MSDs = result / 10	// Dividing by 10 leaves the most significant digits
		
		return funct(LSD, MSDs, depth + 1)
WCK- the only issue I have with the above logic flow is that you have two return statements; 
     it better practice to only have one. I see a way to do this, do you?


// UNIT TESTING
assert funct(0, 0, 11) throws RecursiveDepthException
assert funct(0, 0, -1) throws RecursiveDepthException
assert funct(0, 0, 0) returns 0
assert funct(1, -1, 0) returns 0
assert funct(1, 1, 0) returns 2
assert funct(10, 10, 0) returns 2
assert funct(123, 123, 0) returns 3  
assert funct(123456, 123456, 10) throws RecursiveDepthException
assert funct(-24, 51, 0) returns 9

WCK- missing some test cases; (-123,-123), (maxInt,maxInt), (-maxInt, -maxInt), (maxInt,1), (maxInt,0), etc.

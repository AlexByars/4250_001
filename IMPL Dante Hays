WCK- this is the kind of submission I was looking for. It is a bit overkill but the point was to demonstrate certain good practices such as taking time to 
understand the requirements, come up with a design, document code with meaningful variable names and comments. A few items below prefixed with WCK-
I don't see test cases or test data but since you didn't finish the code, I'm guessing that time was the issue. But, what happens if I pass in a null/empty string
the user input. You tested for the file to exist but what if it is protected and you can't access it? What if it is empty?
Overall, very nice job.

Implementation Exercise

Problem:

Take in a string (from a user or a file), compute the total number of occurrences of each character in the ASCII set. Print out the top three characters (with the most occurrences). Print out how many characters in the ASCII set you didnâ€™t detect. Then print out the string in reverse order.
##########################################################################################################################################################
Requirements:

Mandatory

-	Program shall take input in the form of a string.
-	Program must print top three most frequent ASCII chars.
-	Program must print the number of ASCII chars not found in the string.
-	Program shall print the original string in reverse order.

Optional

-	Program may read the input from console(user).
-	Program may read input from file.
(Must do at minimum one of these but may do both)
-	Program may print out instances of which chars were not found in the set, in addition to the number.
##########################################################################################################################################################
Design

Definition of Done:

-	The program will be able to read in a string from an input source and then print and display in a meaningful manner, the three most occurring ASCII chars, the number that did not occur at all in the string, and the string in reverse order.

Pseudo Code: (IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON)

Prompt user for input type (from console or file)

Capture either their string input from the console or the name of the file to read
	If from a file, read in that file

Set the value from previous to be the working string

Read in CSV of printable ascii chars

Run loop using .Count function for each char
	For each char:
	if count is 0 append to no occurrence list
	else if count > 0 append to count list

Sort count list and print top three char                        WCK- what if there is a tie involving more than the first 3 (count is 4,3,2,2,2,2,1,...)
                                                                     if you only print out the first 3, is this meeting the requirements
								     

Print no occurrence list size

Print reverse string

Python Code

import pandas as pd
import os.path

class Charset:
    char = ""
    count = ""

#Prompt user for input
inputSuccess = 1

while inputSuccess > 0:    

WCK- perhaps it is my ignorance of python, but in the languages I know, using break and continue to manage the loop is not considered good practice.
     why not just let control fall to the end and allow the conditional expression determine if you break or continue

    consoleOrFile = input("Enter string from Terminal or File? (Enter T or F)\n")

    #if from console
    if consoleOrFile == "T":
        workingString = input("\nEnter string and press enter:\n")
        inputSuccess = 0
        break

    #if from file
    elif consoleOrFile == "F":
        filePath = input("\nEnter full file path:\n")
        #check if it's a valid filepath
        if os.path.exists(filePath) == True:            WCK- good validation!!
            workingString = pd.read_csv(filePath)
            inputSuccess = 0
            break
        #if not send em back to the beginning
        elif os.path.exists(filePath) == False:             WCK- restate the condition that causes elif to run? why not just have "else"
            print("\nThe filepath was invalid or the file does not exist\n\n")
            continue

    #if they typed something other than "T" or "F" send em back to try again
    else:
        print("\nInvalid input\n\n")
        if inputSuccess == 1:
            continue

#read csv of printable ascii char
#ascii = pd.read_csv etc etc
